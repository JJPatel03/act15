Build a fully functional Inventory Management App using Flutter and Firebase
Firestore.

## Advance Features

In my app, I added two enhanced features to make the inventory system easier to use and more informative. The first feature is a search and filter option on the home screen, which lets users quickly find items by name or filter them by category. This helps keep the list organized and saves time when managing many products. The second feature is a dashboard screen that gives a quick overview of the inventory, including the total number of items, the total value of all stock, and a list of out-of-stock items. These features make it easier to keep track of inventory at a glance.

## How to use app
When you open the app, you’ll see a list of all your inventory items in real time. You can add a new item by tapping the “+” button at the bottom of the screen then filling out the form with the item’s details. To edit an existing item just tap on it and make your changes then save. If you want to remove an item, swipe it to the left or open it and tap the delete button. You can also use the search bar to find items by name or choose a category from the dropdown to filter the list. For a quick summary of your inventory, tap the analytics icon in the top-right corner to open the dashboard and see totals, values, and out-of-stock items.
