Build a fully functional Inventory Management App using Flutter and Firebase
Firestore.

## Advance Features

In my app, I added two enhanced features to make the inventory system easier to use and more informative. The first feature is a search and filter option on the home screen, which lets users quickly find items by name or filter them by category. This helps keep the list organized and saves time when managing many products. The second feature is a dashboard screen that gives a quick overview of the inventory, including the total number of items, the total value of all stock, and a list of out-of-stock items. These features make it easier to keep track of inventory at a glance.
